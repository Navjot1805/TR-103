# Daily Diary – Prompt Engineering Training (Week 1 to Week 4)

## DAY 1 ACTIVITY
Website Summarizer using Gemini AI Studio

[Web Summarizer Repository](https://github.com/Navjotkarkhal/Web-Summarizer)
This project takes a website URL as input and uses prompt-based interaction with Gemini AI Studio to extract and rephrase the main content of the webpage. Built using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Gemini AI, it showcases how prompting techniques can drive intelligent web content summarization.

## DAY 2 ACTIVITY
Text To Image 
[Text_to_Image Repository](https://github.com/Navjotkarkhal/Image_Generator/tree/main)
This project generates realistic images from user-provided text prompts using a pre-trained Hugging Face model. Built with Python and Transformers, it showcases AI-powered visual creativity driven by natural language input

## DAY 3 ACTIVITY 
Google Gemini Studio Set Up
Temperature : Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness or creativity of a language model’s output.A lower temperature (e.g., 0) makes the output more predictable and focused, while a higher temperature (e.g., 1) makes it more diverse and creative.
Tokens:Tokens are the basic units of text that AI models process. A token can be a word, part of a word, punctuation, or even a space.

## Day 4
Gemini AI-Based Recipe Generator
[AI-Based Recipe Generator](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221qfwNKVPgwlgyFRxD2VDDVjI2zG0x87wg%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22109923572161438867239%22,%22resourceKeys%22:%7B%7D%7D&usp=sharing)
This project was built using **Google Gemini AI Studio**. It allows users to input ingredients or a food-related description and generates a complete, creative recipe including title, ingredients, preparation steps, and tips.

## DAY 5 ACTIVITY
Speech to Text Convertor 
[Speech_Test Repository](https://github.com/Navjotkarkhal/Web-Summarizer)
This project records voice input, converts it to text using speech recognition, and then refines the transcription using the Gemini API for grammar and punctuation correction. Built with Python, SoundDevice, SpeechRecognition, and Google Generative AI, it demonstrates how prompting techniques can enhance raw voice data into clean, structured text.

## DAY 6 ACTIVITY
Text to Speech
Speech to Speech Convertor 
[Speech_Speech Repository](https://github.com/Navjot1805/Speech_to_Speech)
Speech-to-Speech AI Assistant is a voice-interactive system that listens to user speech, transcribes it using Whisper, generates a smart AI response, and speaks it back using text-to-speech — creating a seamless human-like conversation loop.
